# CARLA Desktop

[CARLA](http://carla.org), the open-source simulator for autonomous driving research, is notoriously painful to setup (as of Jan, 2020). The documentation is filled with version conflicts, outdated examples, and innacurate instructions. 

This repository provides easy-to-follow instructions for getting a CARLA environment up and running using a GPU-enabled virtual machine on AWS.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account
* Some free time on your hands

## What you'll accomplish

By following the steps below, you will

1) [Launch a GPU-based virtual machine on Amazon Web Services](./Step1-AWS.md) (~15 minutes)
2) [Install CARLA](./Step2-CARLA.md) (~10 minutes)
3) [Build Unreal Engine](./Step3-Unreal.md) (~2 hours!)
4) [Simulate!](./Step4-Simulate.md)

When you've completed these steps, you'll have a working CARLA environment
